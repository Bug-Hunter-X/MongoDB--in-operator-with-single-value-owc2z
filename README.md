# MongoDB $in Operator with Single Value Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error when using MongoDB's `$in` operator with a single value. The `$in` operator is intended for checking if a field's value exists within an array.  Using it with a single value will not produce the expected results and might return an empty set even if a match exists.

## Bug Description
The `$in` operator is incorrectly used with a single value instead of an array.  This leads to an unexpected empty result. The correct approach involves using a direct comparison operator, such as `=` or `$eq`.

## Solution
The solution involves replacing the `$in` operator with a simple equality check using `=` or `$eq`.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up a MongoDB connection (replace with your connection string).
3. Run the `bug.js` script.  Observe the unexpected result.
4. Run the `bugSolution.js` script. Observe the correct results.
